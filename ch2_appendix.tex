  Macroecology meets evolution''}

Researchers have put forward to set of ``network metrics,'' including
nestedness \citep{bascompte2003, ulrich2009} and modularity
\citep{newman2004, olesen2007}, to understand the complex structure of
ecological networks. Null models are used to evaluate the statistical
significance of these metrics and to compare between networks of
different size \citep{ulrich2009}. We compare the results derived from
two common null models: the ``probabilistic null'' of
\cite{bascompte2003} using the relative degree distributions of plants
and herbivores as weights while randomizing links and suffers from
high Type II error \citep{ulrich2009}; the ``fixed-fixed null''
\citep{ulrich2009} maintains the exact number of links assigned to
each species while randomizing which interactors fill the requisite set
of links and suffers from high Type I error \citep{ulrich2009}. We find that
using these different null models does not change any trends in our
network statistics across the Hawaiian chronosequence but different
null models do influence the sign and significance of the network
metrics (Fig. \ref{figSupp:netMetComp}). We therefore do not interpret
the sing or significance of the metrics but only their relative trends
across site age.

Because these networks are based on opportunistic data associated with
species descriptions, and not based on standardized ecological
surveys, we cannot interpret patterns in network metrics without
evaluating possible sampling biases \citep{nielsen2007, gibson2011,
  rivera2012}.  To do so we rarify networks by the number of Hemiptera
species included and, for each subsampled network, re-calculate
nestedness and modularity z-scores. This rarefaction procedure shows
that nestedness is very sensitive to network size
(Fig. \ref{figSupp:rfy}), a known property of nestedness
\citep{nielsen2007, gibson2011, rivera2012}. However the relative
nestedness z-scores across networks remain qualitatively similar to
those observed for the complete networks (Fig. \ref{figSupp:rfy}).
Modularity depends on network size in a more variable way
(Fig. \ref{figSupp:rfy}). Modularity is expected to decrease with
network size \citep{rivera2012} and so the marked increase in
modularity with network size on Haleakala is unexpected. However in
light of the large number of highly specialized taxa this pattern is
more reasonable---if most species only have within module links then
removing these species through subsampling will only reduce overall
modularity.  Thus this pattern speaks to the high level of
specialization on Haleakala, and to a lesser extent at Kokee which
also shows a slight increase in modularity with network size
(Fig. \ref{figSupp:rfy}).

    and magnitude of metrics but not on their relative trends. The
