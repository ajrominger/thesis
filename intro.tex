biodiversity, or the
fact that life takes many forms not just one, is a striking feature of
our world. More striking still is the fact that over the past 550
million years biodiversity has fluctuated between periods of rapid
diversification, such as the Cambrian explosion, and devastating
extinctions, such as the end Permian extinction.  We shed light on how
these seemingly complicated biodiversity patterns share common
mechanisms with other striking features of our world such as weather,
a non-equilibrium physical system, and vagaries of the stock market.
