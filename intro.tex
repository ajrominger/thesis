Biodiversity is a striking feature of our world. Diverse ecosystems
provide humanity with irreplacable services \citep{dailyETC} and yet
predicting biodiversity's dynamics---a key goal in order to better
manage and preserve it---continues to ellude ecologists and
evolutionary biologists \citep{mcgill, somePaleo}. Over the past 550
million years biodiversity has fluctuated between periods of rapid
diversification, such as the Cambrian explosion, and devastating
extinctions, such as the end Permian extinction \citep{sepk,
  alroy}. In the Modern, where we can directly sample living
assemgladges of species, surprising regularities are found in the
distributions of population sizes, resource uses and trophic
interactions across species \citep{hubbell, nekola, harte, martinez,
  bascompte}. Thus to predict diodiversity we must embrace both the
extreme variability and contingency of its history as well as the
persistent emergent similarities in macroscopic patterns across
systems. Statistical mechanics provides a powerful framework for
perdicting macroscopic generalities in systems composed of many
constituient, potentially complex, parts \citep{}.  In this thesis I
use the predictive power of statistical mechanics to understand the
origin of pervasive patterns in biodiversity, such as the distribution
of its fluctuations through time and the distribution of trophic
interactions across species.  I combine this approach with an explicit
consideration of the evolutionary procees leading to these
biodiversity patterns, seeking to understand how biological evolution
drives biological systems away from the steady state idealizations
predicted by statistical mechanics.  Thus I show using examples from
the fossil record and rapidly evolving island biotas that general
patterns in biodiversity emerge from a combination of the statistical
mechanics of large systems and the unique non-equilibrium dynamics
imparted to biological systems by their evolutionary history.

Biodiversity theory seeks to predict observed assembladges of species
\citep{hubbell2001}. Historically, this pursuit has been dominated by
``bottom-up'' theories that attempt to account for all possible
mechanistic interactions between species and their environments
\citep{haegeman2008}, which invariable depend on the specifics of the
systems for which they are developed and cannot be generally applied
across the breadth of biodiversity.  The pursuit of simple universal
theory was ignited by the work of \citet{macWilson} whose quantitative
description of island assembdaged as a dynamic equilibrium of
colonization and extinction paved the way for more nuanced theories
such as the unified neutral theory of biodiversity
\citep{hubbell2001}, predicting the species abundance distribution of
any given local community based on the stationary distribution of a
birth-death-immigration-speciation process.

Surprisingly the patterns these theories seek to predict do not appear
to be unique to biology \citep{nekola}, implying that the mechanisms
leading to these outcomes should not be uniquely biological.  Indeed,
there is historical precidence in ecology to consider macroscopic
properties of assembladges, such as the species abundance
distribuiton, as the outcome of general statistical laws
\citep{fisher, preston, mcgill}. This ``non-mechanistic'' line of
thinking has culminated in purely statistical theories of
biodiversity, such as the maximum entorpy theory of ecology
\citep{harte2011}. Such theories paralelle the coarse-graining of
statistical mechanics, where the details of how micro-states interact
(e.g. particles in the case of theoretical physics or populations in
the case of biology) are averaged over in order to predict the
behavior of the system as a whole.

The application of coarse-graining in ecology has met with
considerable emperical success \citep[e.g.][]{harte2011, others}, yet
biology differs fundamentally from statistical physics because of the
non-Markovian memory imparted to species and populations due to common
inheretance of genomes and niche-constructed environments
\citep{nicheCons} that are the result of natural selection.  If
biological systems are in steady state they have the chance to
overcome the effect of evolutionary contingency, but far from
equilibrium the importance of evolutionary history should be clearly
seen in deviations between observed biodiversity patterns and
statistical idealizations thereof.

Here I use a branch of non-equilibrum statistical physics, known as
super-statistics \citep{beck}, to demonstrate that the complex
dyanimic of diversity fluctuations through time arrises from the same
non-equilibrium processes that can describe complexity in large
physical \cite{beck2004} and social systems \cite{fuentes2009}. 

To further explore the importance of evolutionary history I also test
an statistical equilibrium theory of biodiveristy \citep[the maximum
entropy theory of ecology][]{harte2011} across rapidly evoloving
arthropod communities of different ages in the Hawaiian
archipelago. This work combines population genetics with the geologic
chronosequence to document the rate of evolutionary community assembly 

biodiversity, need for prediction, attempts at prediction

bottom-up modeling in ecology and need for top-down

lack of evolution in ecological theory

need to broadly test theory


To do so I developed an open source R package
implementing an approach to theory development in ecology based on the
principle of maximum information entropy. This framework seeks to
predict distributions of interest, such as abundance distributions,
without invoking any specific mechanistic assumptions but instead by
finding the solution that an ideal system would reach in equilibrium.
Thus deviations from this theory can reveal the nature of unique
mechanisms behind the observed structure of biodiversity.
