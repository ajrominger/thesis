  Abstract =	 {The fossil record demonstrates that each major
                  taxonomic group has a consistent net rate of
                  diversification and a limit to its species
                  richness. It has been thought that long-term changes
                  in the dominance of major taxonomic groups can be
                  predicted from these characteristics. However, new
                  analyses show that diversity limits may rise or fall
                  in response to adaptive radiations or
                  extinctions. These changes are idiosyncratic and
                  occur at different times in each taxa. For example,
                  the end-Permian mass extinction permanently reduced
                  the diversity of important, previously dominant
                  groups such as brachiopods and crinoids. The current
                  global crisis may therefore permanently alter the
                  biosphere's taxonomic composition by changing the
                  rules of evolution.},

                  χ2-distribution of an intensive variable, but other
                  classes of generalized statistics are obtained as
                  well. We show that for small variance of the

@article{fuentes2009,
  Abstract =	 { <p>Many studies assume stock prices follow a random
                  process known as geometric Brownian motion. Although
                  approximately correct, this model fails to explain
                  the frequent occurrence of extreme price movements,
                  such as stock market crashes. Using a large
                  collection of data from three different stock
                  markets, we present evidence that a modification to
                  the random model---adding a slow, but significant,
                  fluctuation to the standard deviation of the
                  process---accurately explains the probability of
                  different-sized price changes, including the
                  relative high frequency of extreme
                  movements. Furthermore, we show that this process is
                  similar across stocks so that their price
                  fluctuations can be characterized by a single
                  curve. Because the behavior of price fluctuations is
                  rooted in the characteristics of volatility, we
                  expect our results to bring increased interest to
                  stochastic volatility models, and especially to
                  those that can produce the properties of volatility
                  reported here.</p> },

  Abstract =	 {The Phanerozoic fossil record of marine animal
                  diversity covaries with the amount of marine
                  sedimentary rock. The extent to which this
                  covariation reflects a geologically controlled
                  sampling bias remains unknown. We show that
                  Phanerozoic records of seawater chemistry and
                  continental flooding contain information on the
                  diversity of marine animals that is independent of
                  sedimentary rock quantity and
                  sampling. Interrelationships among variables suggest
                  long-term interactions among continental flooding,
                  sulfur and carbon cycling, and macroevolution. Thus,
                  mutual responses to interacting Earth systems, not
                  sampling biases, explain much of the observed
                  covariation between Phanerozoic patterns of
                  sedimentation and fossil biodiversity. Linkages
                  between biodiversity and environmental records
                  likely reflect complex biotic responses to changing
                  ocean redox conditions and long-term sea-level
                  fluctuations driven by plate tectonics.},

  Abstract =	 {Ecological interactions, such as predation and
                  bioturbation, are thought to be fundamental
                  determinants of macroevolutionary trends. A data set
                  containing global occurrences of Phanerozoic fossils
                  of benthic marine invertebrates shows escalatory
                  trends in the relative frequency of ecological
                  groups, such as carnivores and noncarnivorous
                  infaunal or mobile organisms. Associations between
                  these trends are either statistically insignificant
                  or interpretable as preservational effects. Thus,
                  there is no evidence that escalation drives
                  macroecological trends at global and million-year
                  time scales. We also find that taxonomic richness
                  and occurrence data are cross-correlated, which
                  justifies the traditional use of one as a proxy of
                  the other.},

  Abstract =	 {We present a new model for extinction in which
                  species evolve in bursts or `avalanches', during
                  which they become on average more susceptible to
                  environmental stresses such as harsh climates and so
                  are more easily rendered extinct. Results of
                  simulations and analytic calculations using our
                  model show a powerlaw distribution of extinction
                  sizes which is in reasonable agreement with fossil
                  data. We also see several features qualitatively
                  similar to those seen in the fossil record. For
                  example, we see frequent smaller extinctions in the
                  wake of a large mass extinction which arise because
                  there is reduced competition for resources in the
                  aftermath of a large extinction event, so species
                  which would not normally be able to compete can get
                  a foothold, but only until the next cold winter or
                  bad attack of influenza comes along to wipe them
                  out.},
